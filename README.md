# HTML-TO-PDF
## Technology evaluation

This is just a small sample project to showcase PDF report generation. The idea is to use HTML5 and
[Freemarker](http://freemarker.org/) to build up the final template and to use
[Flying Saucer](https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer) to render the PDF.
